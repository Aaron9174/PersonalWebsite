The goal of this is to work on my own web project to better learn the inner processes of node, npm, and other popular web development tools. The overall design for this is to create a website that will easily allow me to story articles to better keep track of what I have read online. At first, it may be something as simple as adding links of the articles that I have read. From there, we will see where it grows. Happy coding.
